BagIns - BagIt Library in Go
============================

This is a library for working with `BagIt <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt>`_
hierarchal file packages.

It uses the `Go Language <http://golang.org/>`_ to leverage its speed and 
concurrency features to take advantage of manipulating bags in a cloud based
enviorment.

I'm fairly new to the Go Language so excuse the prototype nature of the code
in general.
